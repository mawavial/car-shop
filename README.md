## Introduction

Online store PoC


## How to run

I'm still configuring it all but you can run a dev mode using:

```npm run dev```
        or
```npx webpack serve --mode development```

if you are not affraid :)

## TODO LIST:

* Configure production build
* Refact styled components into own dir
* Unit testing
